 >[!warning] Always use a double "new line" if you want it to appear on the website

For example:

```
{text separated by
only one "new line"}
```

will appear as:

{text separated by
only one "new line"}

while

```
{text separated by

two "new lines"}
```

will appear as:

{text separated by

two "new lines"} %%
