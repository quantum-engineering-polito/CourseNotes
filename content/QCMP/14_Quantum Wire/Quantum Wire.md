There is a general rule that applies to confined structures: if the number of degrees of freedom is denoted by $D_f$ and the number of directions of confinement is denoted by $D_c$, then

$$ 
D_{f}+D_{c}=3 
$$
In a quantum wire we have 

$$
D_{f}=1 ; \ D_{c}=2
$$

Which is to say that we have 2 dimension of confinement and one degree of freedom for the electrons.

Let's start from the Schr√∂dinger equation

$$
-\frac{\hbar}{2m} \nabla^{2} \Psi(\bar{r})+V(\bar{r})\Psi(\bar{r}) = E \Psi (\bar{r})
$$

We separate in components the potential:

$$
\displaylines{
V(\bar{r}) = V(x)+V(y)+V(z)
\\\\
V_{z} = 0
\\\\
V_{x},V_{y}=\begin{cases}  
0 && -\frac{a_{x}}{2} \leq x \leq \frac{a_{x}}{2} \text{ and } -\frac{a_{y}}{2} \leq y \leq \frac{a_{y}}{2}\\\\
\infty && \text{otherwise}\\
\end{cases}
}
$$

As we did before (in other scenarios) we solve separately the three dimensions and we sum up the energies and multiply the wavefunctions to get the overall solutions. What we will find is that we have a free particle in the $z$ direction and an infinite potential well in the $x$ and $y$ directions.

Along $z$ direction:

$$
\psi(z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ L_{z} }} e^{ i k_{z} \bar{r} } \qquad E_{z} = \frac{\hbar^{2} k_{z}^{2}}{2m}
$$

Along $x,y$ directions, due to the fact that the potential goes to the infinity at the edges we have the boundary conditions:

$$
\psi_{x}\left( -\frac{a_{x}}{2} \right)=\psi_{x}\left( \frac{a_{x}}{2}\right)=\psi_{y}\left( -\frac{a_{y}}{2} \right)=\psi_{y}\left( \frac{a_{y}}{2} \right) = 0
$$

so the solutions are:

$$
\displaylines{
\psi_{x} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{ a_{x} }}\sin\left( \frac{n_{x}\pi x}{a_{x}} \right)
\\\\
\psi_{y} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{a_{y} }}\sin\left( \frac{n_{y}\pi y}{a_{y}} \right)
}
$$

**These (unlike in $z$) are stationaries waves. They do not propagate in space but they are confined in $x,y$**

The total energy will be:

$$
\displaylines{
E = E_{x}+E_{y}+E_{z}
\\\\
E = \frac{\hbar^{2}\pi^{2}n^{2}_{x}}{2ma_{x}^{2}}+
\frac{\hbar^{2}\pi^{2}n^{2}_{y}}{2ma_{y}^{2}}
+\frac{\hbar^{2}k_{z}}{2m}
}
$$

How many states are there in the parabola? To calculate them we need to apply conditions also in the $z$ direction. The typical conditions that we apply when we want to avoid to deal with surfaces are periodic boundary conditions.

![[PBC.png|500]]

Due to the boundary condition we get that:

$$
k_{z} = \frac{2\pi}{L_{z}}n_{z} \quad n_{z}=0,\pm 1,\pm 2, \dots
$$

# 1D DOS

Starting from the first band $n_x,n_{y}=1$ we can write:

$$
D(E) = \frac{1}{L} \frac{dN(E)}{dE} \quad \left[ \frac{1}{cm \cdot eV} \right]
$$

We can find $N(E)$ geometrically reasoning on the following picture.

![[DOS_Quantum_wire.svg|500]]

$$
N(k) = \frac{2k}{\frac{2\pi}{L_{z}}}\cdot 2 = \frac{2k}{\pi} L_{z}
$$

Recalling the relation between $E$ and $k$ we get:

$$
\displaylines{
k = \sqrt{ \frac{2mE}{\hbar^{2}} }
\\\\
N(E) = \frac{2}{\pi} \sqrt{\frac{2mE}{\hbar^{2}}} L_{z}
\\\\
D(E) = \frac{2}{\pi} \sqrt{\frac{2m}{\hbar^{2}}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{ E }}
}
$$

We can now add the other bands
