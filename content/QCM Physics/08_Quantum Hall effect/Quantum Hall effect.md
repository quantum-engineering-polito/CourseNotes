# Classical case

In the classical case we have a piece of conductive material (the Hall bar in the picture below) with a perpendicular magnetic field $B$ applied. We pass a current through the bar and we measure the two voltages $V_{xx}$ and $V_{xy}$ (which is the Hall voltage).

![[classical case setup.png|300]]

What happens to the electrons flowing in the $x$ direction is that they get deflected by the magnetic field and tend to accumulate on one side of the bar, thus creating a voltage difference in the $y$ direction. As the charge builds up, electrons will start to be subjected to a force generated by the electric field (which is opposite to the one due to $B$). This process will reach a stable condition when the two forces balance out and electrons will move in the $x$ direction only. This happens when 

$$
q (\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B}) = 0
$$

If we measure the resistance we get 

$$
\begin{align}
 & R_{xx} = \frac{L/w}{n  e  \mu} \\
 & R_{xy} = \frac{B}{ne} \quad \text{(Hall resistance)}
\end{align}
$$

As we can see the Hall resistance does not depend on the geometry of the sample.

# Charge in a uniform magnetic field

Before proceeding to the quantum case we need to briefly review the behaviour of a charged particle that moves in a uniform magnetic field. Supposing that the particle has an initial velocity in a plane perpendicular to the field $B$, the particle will start moving in a circle with a radius $R_{C} = v/\omega_{C} = \sqrt{ 2mE } \big/ |eB|$.

# Quantum case

The setup for the quantum case is similar to the previous one and can be seen in the image below.

![[quantum setup.svg|400]]

To study what happens in the quantum case we need to solve the SE in case of both magnetic and electric fields, which is to say: 

$$
\left\{\frac{1}{2m}[\hat{p}-q \vec{A}(\vec{R},t)]^{2}+\cancel{ q\phi(\vec{R},t) }\right\}\psi(\vec{R},t)=-i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\,\psi(\vec{R},t) \tag{1}
$$

Where $q \vec{A}(\vec{R}, t)$ is the momentum component related to the magnetic field #todo add link to vector potential and and the scalar potential is $\phi=0$

Before proceeding we need to find a useful vector potential and we decide to use the **Landau gauge** that will simplify our calculations: 

$$
\vec{A} = (0, B \cdot x, 0)
$$

which is a valid choice since 

$$
\vec{B} = \vec{\nabla} \times \vec{A} = \begin{vmatrix}
\vec{i} & \vec{j} & \vec{k} \\
\frac{ \partial  }{ \partial x }  & \frac{ \partial  }{ \partial y }  & \frac{ \partial  }{ \partial z }  \\
0 & B \cdot x  & 0 
\end{vmatrix} = i(0) + j(0) + k\left( \frac{ \partial B \cdot x }{ \partial x }   - \frac{ \partial 0 }{ \partial y } \right) = \vec{k}B
$$

By inserting the gauge in $(1)$ and doing the math, we get 

$$
\bigg[-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\vec{\nabla}^{2}\underbrace{ -\frac{i e\hbar B \cdot x}{m}\frac{\partial}{\partial y} }_{ \substack{\approx \text{ Lorentz force,} \\ \text{contains } x \text{ and } y }}+\underbrace{ \frac{(e B \cdot x)^{2}}{2m} }_{ \substack{\approx \text{ harmonic osc.} \\ \text{confines the wf in } x} }+\underbrace{ V(z) }_{ \substack{\text{depends on } \\ \text{the material} \\ \text{e.g. 2DEG}} }\bigg]\psi(\vec{R})=E\psi(\vec{R})
$$

The system that we are considering is an electron gas that is free to move in the x and y directions but is tightly confined in the z direction. To solve this Hamiltonian it is possible to separate it into two equations since the magnetic field just affects the movement along x and y axes. The total energy becomes then, the sum of two contributions $E=E_{xy}+E_z$.

### Hamiltonian $x y$ directions:

The vector potential (and hence the Hamiltonian of the system) does not depend on the y-coordinate. And since the Hamiltonian does not depend on y, the momentum operator in the y-direction $\hat{p}_{y}=-i\hbar \frac{ \partial^{2} }{ \partial y^{2} }$ commutes with the Hamiltonian. This means that $\hat{p}_{y}$​ is a constant of motion, and its eigenfunctions are plane waves in the y-direction $e^{ik_{y}y}$ thus we can think about the wave function as a product of a generic (unknown) function $u(x)$ and a plane wave in the $y$ direction: 

$$
\psi(\vec{R}) = u(x) e^{ ik_{y} y }
$$

If we solve the SE with this assumption, we get 

$$
\left[-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\frac{d^{2}}{d x^{2}}+\frac{1}{2}\,m\omega_{c}^{2}\left(x+{\color{blue} \frac{\hbar k_{y}}{e B}} \right)^{2}\right]u(x)=\varepsilon u(x)
$$

which is a [[Harmonic oscillator|quantum harmonic oscillator]] shifted by the value 

$$
\boxed{ x_{k} = - \frac{\hbar k_{y}}{eB}  = -l_{B}^{2} k_{y}} \qquad l_{B} =\sqrt{ \frac{\hbar}{|eB|} }
$$

$l^{2}_{B}$ is called **the magnetic length**.

![[comparison_harmonic_oscillator.png]]

The energy eigenvalues are:

$$
E_{n} = \left( n + \frac{1}{2} \right) \hbar\omega_{c}
$$

Where $\omega_c$ is the **Cyclotron frequency** $\omega_c = |eB|/|m|$. 

This solutions, are called Landau levels, these levels are highly degenerate, meaning many electron states have the same energy. Indeed From the expression one notices that the energy depends only on $n$, not on $k_y$, so states with the same $n$ but different $k_y$ are degenerate. 

What will (intuitively) happen is that we will have a series of identical parabolas each shifted by $x_{k}$ with respect to the previous one.

We notice though that $x_{k}$ itself is dependent on $k_{y}$, which has to be calculated by solving the SE in the $y$ direction.

#todo explain why is IPW + PBC

We get that 

$$
\boxed{k_{y}={\frac{2\pi}{L_{y}}}n_{k_{y}}}
$$

Now we know how distant the parabolas are from each other.

## Number of harmonic oscillators

Since our sample has finite dimensions, the number of harmonic oscillator $N_{B}$ must be finite as well. This number can be calculated as follows:

$x_{k}$ varies between $0$ and $L_{x}$ so we can write 

$$
0 < L_{x} = - \frac{\hbar k_{y}}{eB} < L_{x}
$$

which can be rearranged to find the range of variation of $k_{y}$: 

$$
-\frac{eB}{\hbar}L_{x} < k_{y} < 0
$$

Finally, $N_{B}$ can be calculated as the ratio between the total range of variation of $k_{y}$ and the distance between two $k_{y}$: 

$$
N_{B} = \frac{\left( \frac{eBL_{x}}{\hbar} \right)}{\left( \frac{2\pi}{L_{y}} \right)} = \frac{eB}{2\pi \hbar} L_{x}L_{y}
$$

## Landau levels

Due to the fact that the harmonic oscillator has discrete energy levels with a spacing of $\hbar \omega_{c}$ we can easily draw the density of states:

![[DOS.svg|400]]

The "height" of the Landau levels can be easily determined as 

$$
n_{B} =\frac{N_{B}}{L_{x} L_{y}} = \frac{eB}{2 \pi \hbar}
$$

## Recap

From what we saw so far, we noticed that we have a series of harmonic oscillators that spread along the $x$ direction. Since all the harmonic oscillators have the same energies, there will be a number of degeneracies equal to the number of harmonic oscillators $N_{B}$.
