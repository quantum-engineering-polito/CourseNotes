# Classical case

In the classical case we have a piece of conductive material (the Hall bar in the picture below) with a perpendicular magnetic field $B$ applied. We pass a current through the bar and we measure the two voltages $V_{xx}$ and $V_{xy}$ (which is the Hall voltage).

![[classical case setup.png|300]]

What happens to the electrons flowing in the $x$ direction is that they get deflected by the magnetic field and tend to accumulate on one side of the bar, thus creating a voltage difference in the $y$ direction. As the charge builds up, electrons will start to be subjected to a force generated by the electric field (which is opposite to the one due to $B$). This process will reach a stable condition when the two forces balance out and electrons will move in the $x$ direction only. This happens when 

$$
q (\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B}) = 0
$$

If we measure the resistance we get 

$$
\begin{align}
 & R_{xx} = \frac{L/w}{n  e  \mu} \\
 & R_{xy} = \frac{B}{ne} \quad \text{(Hall resistance)}
\end{align}
$$

As we can see the Hall resistance does not depend on the geometry of the sample.

# Charge in a uniform magnetic field

Before proceeding to the quantum case we need to briefly review the behaviour of a charged particle that moves in a uniform magnetic field. Supposing that the particle has an initial velocity in a plane perpendicular to the field $B$, the particle will start moving in a circle with a radius $R_{C} = v/\omega_{C} = \sqrt{ 2mE } \big/ |eB|$.

# Quantum case

The setup for the quantum case is similar to the previous one and can be seen in the image below.

![[quantum setup.svg|400]]

To study the what happens in the quantum case we need to solve the SE in case of both magnetic and electric fields, which is to say: 

$$
\left\{\frac{1}{2m}[\hat{p}-q \vec{A}(\vec{R},t)]^{2}+\cancel{ q\phi(\vec{R},t) }\right\}\psi(\vec{R},t)=-i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\,\psi(\vec{R},t) \tag{1}
$$

Where $q \vec{A}(\vec{R}, t)$ is the momentum component related to the magnetic field (not sure).

Before proceeding we need to find a proper vector potential and we decide to use the **Landau gauge**: 

$$
\vec{A} = (0, B \cdot x, 0)
$$

which is a valid choice since 

$$
\vec{B} = \vec{\nabla} \times \vec{A} = \begin{vmatrix}
\vec{i} & \vec{j} & \vec{k} \\
\frac{ \partial  }{ \partial x }  & \frac{ \partial  }{ \partial y }  & \frac{ \partial  }{ \partial z }  \\
0 & B \cdot x  & 0 
\end{vmatrix} = i(0) + j(0) + k\left( \frac{ \partial B \cdot x }{ \partial x }   - \frac{ \partial 0 }{ \partial y } \right) = \vec{k}B
$$

By inserting the gauge in $(1)$ and doing the math, we get 

$$
\bigg[-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\vec{\nabla}^{2}\underbrace{ -\frac{i e\hbar B \cdot x}{m}\frac{\partial}{\partial y} }_{ \substack{\approx \text{ Lorentz force,} \\ \text{contains } x \text{ and } y }}+\underbrace{ \frac{(e B \cdot x)^{2}}{2m} }_{ \substack{\approx \text{ harmonic osc.} \\ \text{confines the wf in } x} }+\underbrace{ V(z) }_{ \substack{\text{depends on } \\ \text{the material} \\ \text{e.g. 2DEG}} }\bigg]\psi(\vec{R})=E\psi(\vec{R})
$$

Since the potential is additive, we can factor out the $z$ direction, then

>our final wave function shell be multiplied by the z-function and the corresponding energy should be added. (Raffone, slide 15)

We can also see that the vector potential does not depend on $y$ and thus we can think about the wave function as a product of a generic (unknown) function $u(x)$ and a plane wave in the $y$ direction: 

$$
\psi(\vec{R}) = u(x) e^{ ik_{y} y }
$$

If we solve the SE with this assumption, we get 

$$
\left[-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\frac{d^{2}}{d x^{2}}+\frac{1}{2}\,m\omega_{c}^{2}\left(x+{\color{blue} \frac{\hbar k_{y}}{e B}} \right)^{2}\right]u(x)=\varepsilon u(x)
$$

which is a [[Harmonic oscillator|quantum harmonic oscillator]] shifted by the value 

$$
\boxed{ x_{k} = - \frac{\hbar k_{y}}{eB}  = -l_{B}^{2} k_{y}} \qquad l_{B} =\sqrt{ \frac{\hbar}{|eB|} }
$$
all with energy eigenvalues 

$$
E_{n} = \left( n + \frac{1}{2} \right) \hbar\omega_{c}
$$


What will (intuitively) happen is that we will have a series of identical parabolas each shifted by $x_{k}$ with respect to the previous one.

We notice though that $x_{k}$ itself is dependent on $k_{y}$, which has to be calculated by solving the SE in the $y$ direction.

#todo explain why is IPW + PBC

We get that 

$$
\boxed{k_{y}={\frac{2\pi}{L_{y}}}n_{k_{y}}}
$$

Now we know how distant the parabolas are from each other.

## Number of harmonic oscillators

Since our sample has finite dimensions, the number of harmonic oscillator $N_{B}$ must be finite as well. This number can be calculated as follows:

$x_{k}$ varies between $0$ and $L_{x}$ so we can write 

$$
0 < L_{x} = - \frac{\hbar k_{y}}{eB} < L_{x}
$$

which can be rearranged to find the range of variation of $k_{y}$: 

$$
-\frac{eB}{\hbar}L_{x} < k_{y} < 0
$$

Finally, $N_{B}$ can be calculated as the ratio between the total range of variation of $k_{y}$ and the distance between two $k_{y}$: 

$$
N_{B} = \frac{\left( \frac{eBL_{x}}{\hbar} \right)}{\left( \frac{2\pi}{L_{y}} \right)} = \frac{eB}{2\pi \hbar} L_{x}L_{y}
$$

## Landau levels

Due to the fact that the harmonic oscillator has discrete energy levels with a spacing of $\hbar \omega_{c}$ we can easily draw the density of states:

![[DOS.svg|400]]

The "height" of the Landau levels can be easily determined as 

$$
n_{B} =\frac{N_{B}}{L_{x} L_{y}} = \frac{eB}{2 \pi \hbar}
$$

## Recap

From what we saw so far, we noticed that we have a series of harmonic oscillators that spread along the $x$ direction. Since all the harmonic oscillators have the same energies, there will be a number of degeneracies equal to the number of harmonic oscillators $N_{B}$.
