# Classical case

In the classical case we have a piece of conductive material (the Hall bar in the picture below) with a perpendicular magnetic field $B$ applied. We pass a current through the bar and we measure the two voltages $V_{xx}$ and $V_{xy}$ (which is the Hall voltage).

![[classical case setup.png|300]]

What happens to the electrons flowing in the $x$ direction is that they get deflected by the magnetic field and tend to accumulate on one side of the bar, thus creating a voltage difference in the $y$ direction. As the charge builds up, electrons will start to be subjected to a force generated by the electric field (which is opposite to the one due to $B$). This process will reach a stable condition when the two forces balance out and electrons will move in the $x$ direction only. This happens when 

$$
q (\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B}) = 0
$$



If we measure the resistance we get 

$$
\begin{align}
 & R_{xx} = \frac{L/w}{n  e  \mu} \\
 & R_{xy} = \frac{B}{ne} \quad \text{(Hall resistance)}
\end{align}
$$

As we can see the Hall resistance does not depend on the geometry of the sample.

#todo how does this relates to slide 4 of Raffone?

# Quantum case

To study the what happens in the quantum case we need to solve the SE in case of both magnetic and electric fields, which is to say: 

$$
\left\{\frac{1}{2m}[\hat{p}-q \vec{A}(\vec{R},t)]^{2}+\cancel{ q\phi(\vec{R},t) }\right\}\psi(\vec{R},t)=-i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\,\psi(\vec{R},t) \tag{1}
$$

Before proceeding we need to find a proper vector potential and we decide to use the **Landau gauge**: 

$$
\vec{A} = (0, B_{x}, 0)
$$

which is a valid choice since 

$$
\vec{B} = \vec{\nabla} \times \vec{A} = \begin{vmatrix}
\vec{i} & \vec{j} & \vec{k} \\
\frac{ \partial  }{ \partial x }  & \frac{ \partial  }{ \partial y }  & \frac{ \partial  }{ \partial z }  \\
0 & B_{x}  & 0 
\end{vmatrix} = i(0) + j(0) + k\left( \frac{ \partial B_{x} }{ \partial x }   - \frac{ \partial 0 }{ \partial y } \right) = \vec{k}B
$$

By inserting the gauge in $(1)$ and doing the math, we get 

$$
\bigg[-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\vec{\nabla}^{2}\underbrace{ -\frac{i e\hbar B_{x}}{m}\frac{\partial}{\partial y} }_{ \substack{\approx \text{ Lorentz force,} \\ \text{contains } x \text{ and } y }}+\underbrace{ \frac{(e B_{x})^{2}}{2m} }_{ \substack{\approx \text{ harmonic osc.} \\ \text{confines the wf in } x} }+\underbrace{ V(z) }_{ \substack{\text{depends on } \\ \text{the material} \\ \text{e.g. 2DEG}} }\bigg]\psi(\vec{R})=E\psi(\vec{R})
$$

Since the potential is additive, we can factor out the $z$ direction, then

>our final wave function shell be multiplied by the z-function and the corresponding energy should be added. (Raffone, slide 15)
