## Brief introduction to communication

### Shannon-Weaver model

The basic concept of communication can be represented by the Shannon-Weaver model. The idea is that communication is a linear one-way process, involving **six elements**: The **source** of information, the **transmitter** that sends a signal to the **channel** (affected by **noise**); the signal reaches the **receiver** which delivers the information to the **destination**.

### Analog vs Digital signals

Analog signals are continuous signals varying with time: the signal (**S**) is generated by encoding the message (**T** a time-varying quantity) in some time-varying signal and sent to the receiver. The signal (**S**) is decoded in order to obtain some information about the original message (**T**)
The two main problems with analog signals are the susceptibility to noise and the difficulty to copy them.

Instead digital signals are generated by encoding a discrete set of values, the accuracy depends on the sampling rate and they show more advantages compared to the analog ones: are less affected by noise, cheaper to produce, easier to process and the bandwidth is easier to manage.

The classical unit for a digital signal is called "bit" and follows the usual representation of **0/1**. This notation generally is the representation of an electrical signal with two possible values; even introducing some noise the bit is more robust compared to an analog signal.

### Quantum communication

Quantum mechanics offers both superposition and entanglement to exploit in new communication systems.
To have a better understanding on notations and representations of qubits that will be used in the following notes, is recommended to look at:
- Bloch sphere:  [[Flying Electron Qubit#Bloch sphere|Condensed Matter lecture about qubits]]
- Dirac notation: [[Formulas#Dirac notation|Formulas from QMPI]]
- Gates:  [[Qubit Electronics/01_Introduction/Introduction#Gates|Q Electronics introductive lecture]]


### Measurements 

A measurement extracts information from a qubit, basically tells us if the qubit is in the state $\ket{0}$ or in the state $\ket{1}$. 

#### Measurement in the Pauli Z basis

Considering the measurement as a big box, fed with the prepared state, a general one could be $\ket{\psi}=\alpha \ket{0}+\beta \ket{1}$. There are two possible values as measurement outputs, and we will assign them the values of $+1$ and $-1$.
The probability of these outcomes, corresponding to state $\ket{0}$ and state $\ket{1}$ are given by their probability amplitudes. Immediately after the measurement the state collapses either onto $\ket{0}$ or onto $\ket{1}$: 

$$
\displaylines{
Prob(+1)= |\alpha|^{2} \implies \text{state is } \ket{0} \\
Prob(-1)= |\beta|^{2} \implies \text{state is } \ket{1} 
}
$$

This particular measurement is referred as *measurement in the computational basis* or in the *Pauli Z basis*.

#### Measurement in the Pauli X basis

The measurement can be done in other basis, like the X basis, looking at the probability of finding the qubit either in state $\ket{+}$ or $\ket{-}$. 

With  $\ket{\psi}=\frac{\alpha+\beta}{\sqrt{ 2 }}\ket{+}+\frac{\alpha-\beta}{\sqrt{ 2 }}\ket{-}$ (obtained from simple algebraic passages) the measurement probabilities are the ones in the picture

Like before, the measurement collapses the qubit's state either in $\ket{+}$ or $\ket{-}$

#### Basis

From linear algebra: a basis is a set of vectors that allows you to write down any other vector. 

The generic state $\ket{\psi}$ can be written in terms of the states $\ket{i}$ and $\ket{-i}$ (Pauli Y basis), as well as in the X basis as we saw before. The state is not changed but just the representation of it.

An important concept is the inner product, is basically a dot product between two vectors and tells us the "overlapping" between two quantum states. A *bra* is needed for the product, and is defined as the adjoint of a given state $\ket{\psi}$

$$
\bra{\psi}=(\ket{\psi})^{\dagger} = \begin{pmatrix}
\alpha \\ \beta
\end{pmatrix}^{\dagger} = \begin{pmatrix}
\alpha^{*} & \beta^{*}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

The inner product between $\ket{\psi}=\alpha \ket{0}+\beta \ket{1}$ and $\ket{\phi}=\gamma \ket{0}+\delta \ket{1}$ is:

$$
\braket{\phi|\psi}= \begin{pmatrix}
\gamma^{*}& \delta^{*}
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}
\alpha \\ \beta
\end{pmatrix} =\alpha\gamma^{*}+\beta\delta^{*}  
$$

The state is normalized when $\braket{\psi|\psi}= |\alpha|^{2}+|\beta|^{2}=1$ 
Two states are orthogonal when $\braket{\phi|\psi}=0$
