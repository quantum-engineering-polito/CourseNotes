# Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation

The main process that allows the lasing process is the stimulated emission, one of the three fundamental ways in which light interacts with matter: stimulated absorption, spontaneous emission and again stimulated emission.

## Stimulated absorption

In the atomic model the stimulated absorption is when an atom initially in the ground state interacts with an incoming photon. If the frequency of the photon, hence its energy, matches the gap between the ground state and an excited state of the atom, the photon may be absorbed and the atom will be excited.

## Spontaneous emission

Happens when an initially excited atom emits a photon without any external stimulus; the emitted photon has the energy equal to the energy gap between the excited and the ground state (considering a two level system) and is emitted in a random direction.


## Stimulated emission

On the other hand stimulated emission requires an incoming photon, that interacting with the atom "forces"  the emission of a photon, with the same frequency, same direction and same phase as the incident one







# Optical cavity

$$ \dot{n}  $$ 

if the n of exc states the dn/dt is positive and we have lasing
the material exhibits a threshold behaiour in N0, the threshold is at k/G
non linearity in the emission of light

in a spectral pov, the cavity also acts as a filter, filtering out 

# Spectral POV

## forced oscillator

## forced damped oscillator

the oscillation depends on the losses and the frequencies, in the spectral stdy we see a peak, non asymptotic (thanks to the damping)

# resonance rlc (analogy)
